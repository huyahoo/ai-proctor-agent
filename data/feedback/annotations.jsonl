There is no observable instance of either student making a side-gaze towards the other, let alone a sustained one exceeding 2 seconds. Their head positions and apparent eye lines remain directed downwards at their respective desks.\n2.  **Student 1 OR student 2 makes a distinct pointing/hand gesture towards other's paper/screen:** Neither student 1 nor student 2 makes any distinct pointing or hand gestures towards the other's paper or screen in any of the provided frames. Both students' hands remain on their own desks, engaged in writing or holding their materials.\n3.  **Material exchange between students 1 & 2 detected:** There is no visible exchange of materials between student 1 and student 2 at any point in the image sequence. Both students remain seated and focused on their individual tasks without any interaction.\n\nSince none of the conditions for \"Collaborative Cheating: Peeking/Signaling\" are met, the classification falls under the \"Else\" clause.", "human_feedback": "confirmed_cheating", "image_path_in_dataset": "images/collaborative_gaze_correlation_66_6178_confirmed_cheating.jpg"}
