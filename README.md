# Proctor Agent

An intelligent proctoring system that uses computer vision and AI to detect potential academic misconduct during exams. This project was developed for the "HACK U TOKYO 2025" hackathon organized by LINE YAHOO Corporation.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track multiple students simultaneously using computer vision
- **Gaze Analysis**: Detect suspicious eye movements and attention patterns
- **Pose Estimation**: Monitor body language and posture for potential cheating
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Use LLMs and VLMs to verify and explain suspicious activities
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface for monitoring and reviewing exam sessions
- **Feedback Learning**: System improves over time through human feedback

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.10
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- NVIDIA drivers
- Conda package manager

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/proctor-agent.git
cd proctor-agent
```

2. **Create and activate conda environment**
- This command creates a new conda environment named `proctor-agent` and installs all necessary dependencies from the `environment.yml` file.
- Note that you should change CUDA toolkit version suitable for your environment.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate proctor-agent
```

3. **Configure environment variables**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your Gemini API key
```
